This folder contains the config files for some of the scripts in the obove folder. There is always a *default* config file to show which paramters have to be set for a certain script. This can then be copied and altered in order to play with different parameter configurations

It would be nice to use [sumatra](http://neuralensemble.org/trac/sumatra/) to play with different parameters and to repeat experiments. I used this already for [another project](https://github.com/dedan/runs-gensim) were a basic sumatra setup can be found. [Another explanation](https://github.com/dedan/runs-gensim/blob/master/HOWTO.md) of how I used sumatra.
