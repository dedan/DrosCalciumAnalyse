# Explanation of this folder:

During cleaning up this repository I found files which we used in the past but are not running anymore due to several possible reasons:

* someone broke the file in an old commit without testing it afterwards again.
* the structure of the data changed in a way that is not compatible with the code anymore.

If I notice this only during cleaning up the code the files are properly not used anymore for the current analysis, yet they might be useful if we want to go back to something or have the the feeling: Haven't I programmed something similar already!??

I'll try to add a short explanation to each of them in the docstrings..
